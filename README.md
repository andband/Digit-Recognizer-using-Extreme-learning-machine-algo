# Digit-Recognizer-using-Extreme-learning-machine-algo
 In project we use the mnist dataset to recognize digit using ELM algorithm.The dataset used is taken from KAGGLE and several activation functions are tried but the code works best on ReLu. An accuracy of 0.973 is achieved whe we use 8000 hidden layers. 
ELM is a very fast algorithm than svm and backpropagation it use single feed forward network to classify the datsets. In some practical experiments ELM is found to be 10000 times faster than svm and backpropagation.
